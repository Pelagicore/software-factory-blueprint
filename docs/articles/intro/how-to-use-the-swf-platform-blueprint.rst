How to use the SWF Platform Blueprint
*************************************

To understand some of the content in this page, please refer to
:ref:`structure-and-nomenclature`.

The first thing that needs to be done within a project is for the
project to create it's own project specific SWF. This is done by
creating a Deployment that extends the Blueprint with more content
and also additional project specific content see :ref:`create-a-swf-deployment`.

For the SWF Deployment to be a suitable project SWF, the structure and
order of the articles need to be set in a suitable way. This is done
by following the template structure and order which is documented in
the Blueprint, and extend that with project specific content. After
the skeletal Deployment has been created according to the above instructions,
please refer to :ref:`create-an-initial-index` for details on how to create
the actual project SWF structure and order of articles.

An example, and reference, SWF Deployment is the PELUX Baseline SWF
Deployment [#pelux-swf]_.
